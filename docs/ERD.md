# E-Commerce Application Development Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the development of a simple E-Commerce application with basic functionalities, focusing on backend skills and minimal frontend design. The application will support two roles: Admin and User, with robust authentication, authorization, and validation mechanisms.

## Technology Stack

### Backend

- **Server-side**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**:sqlite3
- **ORM**: Prisma (for SQL)

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React.js

## Database Design

### ERD Model

An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) will be designed to illustrate the relationships between entities: User, Admin, Product, Category, and WishList.

### Categories

A three-level depth relationship will be implemented using a self-referencing table/collection for categories.

## Authentication and Authorization

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For handling authentication and authorization.
- **Middleware**: Middleware will be created to check roles (Admin, User) and validate tokens.

## API Endpoints

### User Services

- `POST /signup`
- `POST /login`
- `GET /products`, `POST /products`, `PUT /products/:id`, `DELETE /products/:id`
- `GET /wishlist`, `POST /wishlist`, `DELETE /wishlist/:id`

### Admin Services

- `POST /admin/login`
- `GET /admin`, `POST /admin`, `PUT /admin/:id`, `DELETE /admin/:id`
- `GET /users`, `DELETE /users/:id`
- `GET /products`, `DELETE /products/:id`
- `GET /categories`, `POST /categories`, `PUT /categories/:id`, `DELETE /categories/:id`

### Pagination

Pagination will be implemented for all GET requests to handle large datasets efficiently.

## Frontend Development

### Components

- **User Interface**:
  - Login/Signup forms
  - Product list and detail views
  - Wishlist management
- **Admin Interface**:
  - Admin dashboard for managing users, products, and categories

### Minimal Styling

Basic CSS or a minimalistic CSS framework like Bootstrap will be used to ensure the application is presentable without extensive styling.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Backend**:

   - Initialize Node.js project with Express.
   - Setup database connection using Prisma or Mongoose.
   - Define models and relationships.
   - Implement authentication and authorization.
   - Develop API endpoints.

2. **Setup Frontend**:

   - Initialize React.js project.
   - Create necessary components for user and admin interfaces.
   - Integrate with backend APIs.

3. **Testing**:

   - Test all API endpoints using tools like Postman.
   - Ensure all functionalities work as expected.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy backend on a service like Heroku.
   - Deploy frontend on a service like Vercel or Netlify.

By following these steps, you will create a functional E-Commerce application that meets the specified requirements, focusing on backend development and ensuring a minimal yet effective frontend.
